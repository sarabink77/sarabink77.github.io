 <h2> What Interests Me About Art: </h2>

For me art is more than just a hobby, it’s a way of expressing what I’m feeling, make a sense of what I’m thinking and make sense of the world around me. <br/>
<br/>
When there’s something on my mind, a thought I want to develop, or a concept I want to understand, art is always there as a way to sort out the thoughts in my mind. When I’m creating art, I’m in my zone and whatever I’m feeling can be flowed out onto the piece of paper or whatever is front of me.<br/>
<br/>

On top of that art is always teaching me life lessons that I carry with me. One of the major lessons that’s stuck with me the most is the concept that making mistakes isn’t a bad thing. Like when your painting or drawing or creating in general and you make a mistake, sometimes that mistake can seem detrimental at first but in the end you realize how much value it added to the finished product. Maybe that mistake made you change your perspective or method you had previously planned or maybe the mistake made your piece of art all that much more human and unique to who you are. Everybody makes mistakes and there is not a person on earth who is perfect, art displays this concept and teaches me many other things that I can apply to my everyday life.<br/>
<br/>

When you are able to visualize something in your mind and transfer it into the 3D world around you, it is a wonderful thing but when you are able to feel something in your soul and manifest it into being, its magic.<br/>
<br/>

Not only that but when art is able to transmit a feeling, emotion, thought or idea through to someone else just by a visual creation that someone made, it can be a powerful thing. <br/>
<br/>
    
These are the psychological concepts that catch my interest when I think of art, but there’s also just an aesthetic side to it that I love as well<br/>
<br/>

I think it’s incredible how just by matching colors together, changing the way you use your paintbrush, or what materials you use, every artistic decision comes together to change the final effect it is going to have on the viewer.<br/>
<br/>

The way something looks weather it’s pleasing or disturbing, is transmitting a feeling to the person who’s seeing it. This might not be what the creator intended it to read but each person will view the artwork in a different way according to how their thinking or feeling that day. A person might see a piece of art one day and feel sad by it but look at it in a few years when their in a better place and see only hope. <br/>
<br/>

I think that is one of my favorite parts about art, the way that it can mean something different to every single person and have a different effect that is unique to each individual. It’s like a form of communication that anyone can understand no matter where their from, what they look like or who they are.<br/>
<br/>

Many people say don’t judge a book by its cover but in the end we can’t help but do so anyways because the visual representation really makes an impact on how you view the world around you. The thing about art is that the visual representation of it is what tells you the story behind it.
